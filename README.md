# DICTIONARY DESKTOP APPLICATION
#### A simple desktop app applying treeset to save and retrieve data
## Technologies:
Project is created with:
*Java EE
*JavaSwing

## Why I use tree_set for dictionary:
-> Guaranteed log(n) time cost for the basic operations (add, remove and contains).
-> Data is organized under form of tree, so it's more faster in retrieving data.
